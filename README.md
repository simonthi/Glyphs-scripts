# About the scripts

## Transform

### ScaleSelectedFromCenter
It’s weird but Glyphs does not allow you choose the scale origin for selected shapes. This is fixed by this scripts. Selected shapes, enter scale factor, and tranfsorm origin. Scale.

## Test

### adhesiontext Arabic Colored layers
An adaptation of Toshi’s adhesiontext Arabic to take into account the given color for a glyph in the Glyphs UI to choose which characters to include.

## OTFeatures

### UnicodeReporter
A quick script that dumps out Glyphs that have more than one Unicode value assigned and those which have none. Byebye exporting errors!

## Metrics

### MonoChecker
A script that checks all Glyphs against a given width. It then opens a new tab with the found glyphs that do not match the mono width.

### Batch Update Metrics
*EDIT: I found out that this is completely redundant :grinning: I still like it and it does it’s job, but of course it is built into Glyphs.*

A script to make your font fit tighter or looser. Update all Metrics on all Glyphs in one go. Helpful to quickly test tighter and looser fitting. Recommended for more or less properly spaced fonts only.
